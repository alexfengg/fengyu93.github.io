Your score on the final will replace your lowest midterm test score provided that your final exam score is higher than the lowest score of the midterm tests. This policy can only apply once and includes a grade of zero due to a missed test. This policy does not apply for a grade of zero as a penalty of an academic integrity violation.\nGrading Scale 100-90 A, 89-80 B, 79-70 C, 69-60 D, 59-0 F\nHomework Homework problems will be assigned and graded for completeness. A complete homework must detail the work done to obtained a final answer. Assignments will be announced in class and on Webcourses@UCF, and you are expected to complete by the suggested date. You NEED submit your homework on Webcourses@UCF.\nQuiz There are three quizzes, which are scheduled before the midterm weeks. They would be based on the materials including homework problems and lectures examples.\nMidterms There are three midterm exams, which are tentatively scheduled on Feb 4th, March 3rd, and April 7th. The exact dates may be adjusted based on the pace of the course. Each of midterm exam will count 15% of your grade. Any question or mistake about grading must be solved within one week. After one week, your score would not change even the test is graded incorrectly. Don’t alter a marked exam for re-grading and it would result in an alleged academic misconduct.\nFinal Examination It is comprehensive and weighs 35% of your grade. Failure to take the final exam will result in failure of the course. Your final exam score may replace your lowest score of the midterms (i.e. the lowest midterm is dropped and the final exam weighs 50%) provided that it is higher than the lowest score of the midterms. The final exam will be 1:00 PM – 3:50 PM on Tuesday, April 21, 2020.\n",
