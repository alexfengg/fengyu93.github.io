Your score on the final will replace your lowest midterm test score provided that your final exam score is higher than the lowest score of the midterm tests. This policy can only apply once and includes a grade of zero due to a missed test. This policy does not apply for a grade of zero as a penalty of an academic integrity violation.\nGrading Scale 100-90 A, 89-80 B, 79-70 C, 69-60 D, 59-0 F\nHomework Homework problems will be assigned and graded for completeness. A complete homework must detail the work done to obtained a final answer. Assignments will be announced in class and on Webcourses@UCF, and you are expected to complete by the suggested date. You NEED submit your homework on Webcourses@UCF.\nQuiz There are three quizzes, which are scheduled before the midterm weeks. They would be based on the materials including homework problems and lectures examples.\nMidterms There are three midterm exams, which are tentatively scheduled on Feb 4th, March 3rd, and April 7th. The exact dates may be adjusted based on the pace of the course. Each of midterm exam will count 15% of your grade. Any question or mistake about grading must be solved within one week. After one week, your score would not change even the test is graded incorrectly. Don\u0026rsquo;t alter a marked exam for re-grading and it would result in an alleged academic misconduct.\nFinal Examination It is comprehensive and weighs 35% of your grade. Failure to take the final exam will result in failure of the course. Your final exam score may replace your lowest score of the midterms (i.e. the lowest midterm is dropped and the final exam weighs 50%) provided that it is higher than the lowest score of the midterms. The final exam will be 1:00 PM – 3:50 PM on Tuesday, April 21, 2020.\n","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1577836800,"objectID":"489d4b1ef7ad0d2741547d14d8bb2315","permalink":"/courses/mhf3302_2020/","publishdate":"2020-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/courses/mhf3302_2020/","section":"courses","summary":"Current Teaching","tags":null,"title":"MHF 3302, 2020 Spring","type":"courses"},{"authors":["Feng Yu","Yi Yang","Teng Zhang"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1565049600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1565049600,"objectID":"18ddcb564cf41900d0d89a8dbecde184","permalink":"/publication/yu-2019-algorithm/","publishdate":"2020-03-18T06:07:30.730943Z","relpermalink":"/publication/yu-2019-algorithm/","section":"publication","summary":"This work proposes a new algorithm for solving the graph-fused lasso (GFL), a method for parameter estimation that operates under the assumption that the signal tends to be locally constant over a predefined graph structure. The proposed method applies the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm and is based on the decomposition of the objective function into two components. While ADMM has been widely used in this problem, existing works such as network lasso decompose the objective function into the loss function component and the total variation penalty component. In comparison, this work proposes to decompose the objective function into two components, where one component is the loss function plus part of the total variation penalty, and the other component is the remaining total variation penalty. Compared with the network lasso algorithm, this method has a smaller computational cost per iteration and converges faster in most simulations numerically.

In this regard, the functional safety standard, ISO 26262, was drafted with the intention of minimizing risk due to random hardware faults or systematic failure in design of electrical and electronic components of an automobile. However, growing complexity of a modern car has added another potential point of failure in the form of cyber or sensor attacks. Recently, researchers have demonstrated that vulnerability in vehicle's software or sensing units could enable them to remotely alter the intended operation of the vehicle. As such, in addition to safety, security should be considered as an important design goal. However, designing security solutions without the consideration of safety objectives could result in potential hazards. Consequently, in this paper we propose the notion of security for safety and show that by integrating safety conditions with our system-level security solution, which comprises of a modified Kalman filter and a Chi-squared detector, we can prevent potential hazards that could occur due to violation of safety objectives during an attack. Furthermore, with the help of a car-following case study, where the follower car is equipped with an adaptive-cruise control unit, we show that our proposed system-level security solution preserves the safety constraints and prevent collision between vehicle while under sensor attack.","tags":null,"title":"Security for safety: a path toward building trusted autonomous vehicles","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Qi Wang","Jingyue Yang","Feng Yu"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1504224000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1504224000,"objectID":"a12f82eb13d18b3eabf84d763a232901","permalink":"/publication/wang-2017-boundedness/","publishdate":"2020-03-18T06:07:30.730679Z","relpermalink":"/publication/wang-2017-boundedness/","section":"publication","summary":"We consider the following fully parabolic Keller-Segel system $$\\begin{cases} u_t=\\nabla\\cdot(D(u)\\nabla u-S(u)\\nabla v)+u(1-u^\\gamma) \u0026 x\\in\\Omega,t0 \\\\\\ v_t=\\Delta v-v+u \u0026 x\\in\\Omega,t0 \\\\\\ \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial \\nu}=\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial \\nu}=0, \u0026 x\\in\\partial\\Omega,t0 \\end{cases}$$ over a multi-dimensional bounded domain $\\Omega\\subset\\mathbb{R}^N$.
